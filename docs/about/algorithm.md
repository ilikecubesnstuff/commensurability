# The Algorithm

The algorithm computes a normalized volume (between 0 and 1) is roughly split into 4 steps:

1. [Compute a tessellation](algorithm.md#compute-a-tessellation)
2. [Compute side-length values](algorithm.md#compute-side-length-values)
3. [Trim simplices](algorithm.md#trim-simplices)
3. [Compute the normalization](algorithm.md#compute-the-normalization)

## Compute a Tessellation

After integrating an orbit, you should be able to extract a raw point-array of its position over time.
This point array is passed into a tessellation algorithm.

For this specific implementation, [SciPy's Delaunay Tessellation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Delaunay.html) routine is used, which itself calls out to [Qhull](http://www.qhull.org/) under-the-hood.

## Compute Side-Length Values

The important values to compute here are the smallest side-lengths and longest side-lengths of the simplices in our tessellation.
These are what will be used in our trimming condition.

## Trim Simplices

The median of the smallest simplex side-lengths probes the length-scale of "related" parts of an orbit.
If a simplex' longest side is significantly larger than this value, it likely connects unrelated parts of the orbit and should be trimmed.

This threshold is referred to as the **axis ratio**, and is set to `10` by default.
The trimming condition can be written out as so:

$$ \frac{\text{longest side}}{\text{median(all shortest sides)}} > \text{axis ratio} $$

Using different axis ratios accents commensurate tracks to differing degrees.

    All simplices with an axis ratio above 0 are removed.
    Commensurability is calculated from the remaining simplices.

    !!! note "No Total Measure"
        By setting the axis ratio threshold to 0, all simplices are removed.

## Compute the Normalization

There is some delicacy in choosing an appropriate normalization.
The canonical choice is a [hypersphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere) that encapsulates the whole orbit, but orbits rarely fill a whole hypersphere, resulting in poor dynamic range.

In 2D, the default normalization a circle that encapsulates the orbit (routine name is `circle`).
This is the only normalization routine available.

In 3D, the default normalization takes 4 rotated copies of the point array and computes its convex hull (routine name is `convexhull_rot4`).
