"""
This module implements a N-D tessellation and trimming algorithm in the `TessellationGeneric` class.
This module is part of the tessellation package and can be used for general orbit tessellation tasks.

It inherits from `TessellationBase` and includes methods for calculating simplex side lengths
and simplex volumes. The `Normalization` nested class includes normalization methods.
